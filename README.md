# 🧠 DeepSeek Chatbot with Ollama

## 🚀 Overview
This project is a **locally running AI chatbot** powered by **DeepSeek 1.5B parameters** using **Ollama** for efficient model inference. Running the model locally ensures **faster responses, enhanced privacy, and full control over inference** without relying on cloud APIs.

## 🔧 Features
✅ Runs **completely offline** for enhanced privacy 🔒  
✅ Uses **DeepSeek 1.5B** for natural language conversations 🤖  
✅ Powered by **Ollama** for smooth local execution 🐪  
✅ Supports **CPU/GPU acceleration** for optimized performance ⚡  
✅ Open-source and customizable for domain-specific tasks 🛠  

## 📦 Installation
### 1️⃣ Install Ollama
Ollama is required to load and run the DeepSeek model locally.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

### 2️⃣ Download the DeepSeek 1.5B Model
```bash
ollama pull deepseek-ai/deepseek-llm-1.5b
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Chatbot
Start the chatbot using the following command:
```bash
ollama run deepseek-ai/deepseek-llm-1.5b
```

## 🎛 Usage
Once running, you can interact with the chatbot via terminal or integrate it into a web interface.

### Example Query:
```bash
> How does reinforcement learning work?
```

### Example Response:
```
Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns by interacting with an environment...
```

## 💡 Challenges & Optimizations
🔹 **Memory Management** – Optimized to run on resource-limited systems.  
🔹 **Inference Speed** – Fine-tuned configurations for real-time responses.  
🔹 **Customizations** – Can be adapted for specific use cases like **Q&A, summarization, and code generation.**

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- 🏗 **Fine-tuning** for domain-specific applications.
- 🌍 **Multi-model integration** for hybrid chatbot capabilities.
- 🚀 **Benchmarking performance** on various hardware setups.
